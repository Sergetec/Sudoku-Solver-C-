Works for any correct Sudoku, otherwise it will display a message.

## Normal rules apply:
- Each row must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions
- Each column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions
- The digits can only occur once per block *(square)*
- The sum of every single row, column and block *(square)* must equal 45
